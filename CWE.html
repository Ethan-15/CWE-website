    <b>Hello, are you someone who has zero to no coding experience? <br><br/>
If so, this is the right place for you because with this website you’ll be able to learn the basics of python which is the most beginner friendly programming language.<br><br/>

One thing to know when starting to learn about a new programming language, you need to have a completely different mindset as to the way you used to think, this is because when writing code the computer doesn’t accept any mistakes. One should think of it as a completely new language where mistakes aren’t tolerated whatsoever.<br><br/>

Another thing that one may find helpful is to take hand written notes as the information that you will be learning will be new to you and you could easily forget so taking hand written notes can possibly greatly improve the overall progress that you are making.</b>
